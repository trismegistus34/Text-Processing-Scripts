# Text-Processing-Scripts
Simple Python scripts for processing text files, mainly to convert them to HTML. Making them to use for my personal website, and also for the sake of learning Python. Used python-docx (https://github.com/python-openxml/python-docx).

## DOCX_to_HTML
Takes a simply-formatted word document and converts it into HTML, keeping styles.
